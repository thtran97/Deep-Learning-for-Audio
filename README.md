# Deep Learning for Audio  
Implementation of State-of-the-arts in Audio Event Classification, Sound Event Detection (SED) and even more...in Pytorch 

----
## 1. Audio Classification

### CNN-1D Solution:
* Build a conv1d model using directly raw waves from audio files

### CNN-2D Solution:
* Using log-mel spectrogram as features
* CNN-2D as core model, based on image classification task

### Benchmark Dataset
*The benchmark audio dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/data)*

## 2. Sound Event Detection 

***TODO***
